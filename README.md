# Overview
Welcome to the Bering repository, containing the production-ready version of the R package `Bering`. Using Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo, this package conducts hypothesis tests for the time-series climate data presented by Karla Knudson,  Christina Ravelo, Ivano Aiello, Christina Knudson, Michelle Drake, and Tatsuhiko Sakamoto. 

# Repo Contents

- [R](./Bering/R): `R` package code.
- [man](./Bering/man): package documentation and usage of the `Bering` package on  real and simulated data examples.
- [data](./Bering/data): data included in the`Bering` package.


# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

The `Bering` package requires no special hardware.  Because the `Bering` package simulates data sets, computers with greater RAM will complete the analyses more quickly. However, a 'normal' computer should suffice: the analyses were initially completed using a 500 USD netbook purchased in 2012.





## OS Requirements

The `Bering` package was developed and tested on *Linux* operating systems (Ubuntu, to be specific) using version 3.4.3 of R. The  package should be compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.









# Installation Guide

Before installing the `Bering` package, users should have downloaded and installed `R` version 3.1.1 or higher from from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).  Installing R  should take 2 to 3 minutes and installing the Bering package should take 1 to 2 minutes. 



This package will soon be available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). In the meantime, the `devtools` package enables users to  install packages directly from GitHub. Detailed directions can be found online in many places, including [this source](http://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/github.html).
