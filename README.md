This is an R package that does randomization-based hypothesis testing for the time-series climate data presented by Karla Knudson,  Christina Ravelo, Ivano Aiello, Christina Knudson, Michelle Drake, and Tatsuhiko Sakamoto. 



ABOUT R
As detailed by its [website](https://www.r-project.org/), R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.  It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.



INSTALLATION GUIDE
In order to use this package, you must install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and the package itself. Installing R itself should take 2 to 3 minutes, while installing the Bering package should take 1 to 2 minutes. No non-standard hardware or resources are necessary to run R or this package.

This package will soon be available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). If/when the manuscript (which is currently under review) is accepted for publication, the package will be updated to include the entire data set. When the Bering package is available on CRAN, you will be able to install it directly from CRAN, just like you would install any other R package available on CRAN. 

In the meantime, you can install this package directly from GitHub using the devtools package. Detailed directions can be found online in many places, including [this source](http://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/github.html).



UNDERSTANDING THE PACKAGE
The package documentation can be found in the Bering/man folder (found in the Bering repository). Additionally, after you have installed the package, you can find the documentation for any function using the usual R query. For example, to learn more about the function righttailtest, type ?righttailtest into the R console. The documentation for righttailtest will then appear.
