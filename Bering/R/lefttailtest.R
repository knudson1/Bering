#  tests whether the mean of a variable is *lower* during laminated intervals than nonlam.

#Inputs: myvar (the variable of interest), teststat (the test statistic: mean of the variable during laminated - mean during nonlam), pswitchL (the probability of switching from nonlam to lam), pstayL (the probability of having another lam measurement), m (the Monte Carlo sample size for the randomization test)

#Output is a list of length 4: 
##pvalue (one-tailed)
##lammean (vector of laminated means simulated under null hypothesis)
##nonlammean (vector of nonlaminated means simulated under null hypothesis)
##distrib (vector of mean differences, simulated under null hypothesis)
